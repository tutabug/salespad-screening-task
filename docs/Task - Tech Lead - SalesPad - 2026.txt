What This Is: 
Before moving forward, we ask Tech Lead candidates to complete a short practical 
assignment. 
 
It reflects the real work of the role and helps us understand how you think through 
system design, structure backend logic, write clean code, and explain technical 
decisions clearly along the way.. 
 
Tasks 
Your goal is to demonstrate how you think, architect, and implement core logic — not 
build a full system. 
 
1) Architecture Outline  
Prepare a short document (PDF) describing: 
• Core backend architecture 
• Database/data structures 
• Queue & retry logic 
• Basic module/service breakdown 
• How backend will interact with frontend 
• High-level approach for handling multiple channels (Email, WhatsApp, 
LinkedIn, Voice, Ads) 
 
 
Format: 
1–2 pages + 1 small diagram 
We are looking for: clarity, structure, scalability mindset. 
 
 
2) Mini Coding Task  
Build a very simple prototype that demonstrates: 
   Capture a lead (store name + email/phone) 
   Queue a mock outbound email (e.g., "send email") 
   Simulate prospect reply (manual webhook or endpoint) 
   Generate AI-style reply (mock or real API) and send back 
   Log events (lead added, message sent, reply received, AI reply sent, lead status) 
 
Endpoints (or equivalent actions): 
• POST /lead → save a lead 
• POST /send → enqueue outbound message 
• POST /reply → simulate prospect reply 
• POST /ai/reply → generate & enqueue AI response 
• GET /lead/:id → show lead + messages + job history + statuses 
Focus: 
Clear flow, retry thinking, clean structure, simple logic. 
 
 
3) Short Loom Explainer (3-5 mins) 
Record a Loom explaining: 
• Architecture & flow 
• Key decisions 
• What you'd improve if you had more time 
• Explain it as if talking to a non-technical founder 
We are looking for: communication clarity & product mindset. 
 
 
4) Short Daily Report Simulation  
Write a sample daily update as if you were on the job: 
Format: 
   Completed today 
  In progress 
    Blockers / risks 
       Plan for tomorrow 
 
Deliverables 
• GitHub repo 
• Architecture doc (PDF/Markdown) 
• Loom link 
• Daily report text 
 
Important Notes 
• Keep everything simple 
• Mock external systems (email, scraping, AI, etc.) 
• We care about clarity, structure, and thinking, not polish 
 
 
   Evaluation Focus 
Area What we look for 
Architecture Clear, modular thinking 
Code Clean structure & readable flow 
Queue logic Basic retry & state transitions 
Communication Can explain simply & logically 
Self-management Can organize work and report clearly
